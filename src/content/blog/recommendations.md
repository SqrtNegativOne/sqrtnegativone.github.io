everything marked with a ⭐ is absolute peak; and I do not give this lightly. These pieces of media have left an indelible mark on my psyche, or, to borrow a term from Andrew Cunningham, they are "cited authors of my limbic system, and they do not need validation from a tier list." They are pieces of media which you might not like at all... which is fine! I understand if you don't want to play a 10 year old pixel art game about the importance of friendship, but I do think you should at least give them a try.

# Games

## ⭐ Undertale and Deltarune 

## ⭐ Disco Elysium

## ⭐ In Stars and Time


## Portal 2: 8/10
Possibly a perfect game. It's not the best game, or a game that Literally Changed My Life. It's just one of the few perfect games; they had a concept, and executed it flawlessly and perfectly. Not every idea or concept has the capacity to change my life or appeal to my niches. 8/10

## Omori

# Books, blogs, webstories
## HPMOR (webstory)
Extremely controversial, I know. But I liked it. Come at me.

It's just nice to have a protagonist who's more fully aware of the absurdity of the situation they're in. But I do agree that the writing style is terrible and all the characters are terrible. Some of my favourite moments from the book were when 
## The Martian (book)
better than the movie, but the movie did it's best and it's not bad either.

# Movies, shows, youtube videos
## House MD
Honestly probably the best comedy show I have seen. I mean it's more like a drama show, because there is lots of seriousness as well, but it is more like a sitcom, where each episode can be watched without having watched every previous episode.

Unlike shows like Brooklyn 99 or The Office which derive their comedy from autism or stupidity, House MD derives its comedy from pure [competence porn](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetencePorn); everyone is smarter than average, everyone has an opinion, and everyone wants to psycho-analyse every single other person (so much that it just _drives me mad_ sometimes lmao). Even the _patients_ are smart; the most eccentric patients have the most well-written, eloquent and convincing arguments or justifications for why they are who they are.

# Contact Me
If you'd like to go fanboy/fangirl/fan-they nuts in my DMs; I promise I will reciprocate. Or if you'd like to give me any suggestions;\, including suggestions I have already received. Or if you hate me now and would like to kill me. In any case, ways I can be contacted can be found on my frontpage, just feeling a little lazy to get them here. I would just love to read your rants and/or messy thoughts in any form or another. Maybe just go to my Github, copy my entire repo for my website, and reconfigure for yourself?
