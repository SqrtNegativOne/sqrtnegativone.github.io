Hi!

You have made it to my personal about page. Congratulations.

It has frequently been brought under my attention that my messages on Whatsapp and Discord are too long. Too verbose.

Unlucky for them, it's about to get a whole lot worse here because this is the Quarantine zone, so do feel free to _prepare yourselves_.

Here I talk about everything, while talking about nothing. This is a collection of things I am interested in, things I am thinking about, things I need to solidify my thoughts on, writings I need to fully complete, things I felt the need to say but weren't brought up in conversation, things that... are just things.

Welcome to Thingspace.

# Media
I too consoom content.

# AI
Some ramblings I threw in a Discord conversation once.

I used to be extremely pro-AI. I thought AGI would usher in a new golden age of actual, real Enlightenment. A Utopia with all the answers...

There was one fundamental error in my daydreams. I had assumed that the technical problem of attaining AGI and/or AI sentience was a hard goal. Or at least, harder than the sociological problem of creating Semi-Post-Scarcity Luxury Gay Space Communism.

(I thought this quote was from the philosopher John Rawls and I had written it down with this name but actually searching it I can't find who actually said it, and John Rawls definitely didn't say it, but) As someone smarter than me once said, "Technological progress without sociological progress only creates more advanced forms of oppression."

There are some forms of technology which permanently lock-in or significantly accelerate the level of inequality or oppression and resisting them becomes very difficult. Some of these technologies include: 1. Genetic engineering. 2. Surveillance. 3. Artificial Intelligence, or other forms of automation.

I am not a Marxist but looking at this from the lens of "historical materialism"... the bourgeoisie holds power over the proletariat with money. The proletariat holds power over the bourgeoisie through the means of production. I think you can start to see where I'm going with this.

For any revolution to work, for ordinary people to just be heard by governments or billionaires, for ordinary people to just exist, they need some power over the system. Bargaining power. Unemployment by AI or AI taking control over the world isn't the point; that might even be a good thing under better circumstances. The problem is marginalisation.

The more people are involved in the critical infrastructure of a given system, the more power is shared, more people are dependent on each other, and this is what sustains everyone's political, civil, economic rights. Like, this is literally why society exists or came to exist, like its very definition.


basically some things you just can't come back from. If you have created a perfect surveillance state, George Orwell's 1984 is inevitably next. There's just no coming back from either of them; the slopes of the attractor landscape are too steep. There's no revolution you can plan, no democratic party you can create; whatever you do you'll be caught and nothing will be changed, and that's why dystopias are so terrifying (until came the Young Adult genre where "dystopia" just becomes an aesthetic, a backdrop for a love story between teenagers, and the State just being consistently incompetent in face of very mediocre resistance.)

You have to create Utopia before these major technological problems are solved. It's like nuclear weapons, where Level 2 Humanity gets Level 11 weapons from the future; we have barely survived those (and if you don't believe that, you haven't studied enough about the almost-nuclear disasters yet) but what if you get Level 77 weapons? Level 281? Society's progress simply isn't advanced enough to allow for that level of corporation and mutual information. Sociological problems turn out to be harder, and more important, than technological ones.
