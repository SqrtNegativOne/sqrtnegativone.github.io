            <p>everything marked with a ⭐ is absolute peak; and I do not give this lightly. These pieces of media have left an indelible mark on my psyche, or, to borrow a term from Andrew Cunningham, they are &quot;cited authors of my limbic system, and they do not need validation from a tier list.&quot; They are pieces of media which you might not like at all... which is fine! I understand if you don't want to play a 10 year old pixel art game about the importance of friendship, but I do think you should at least give them a try.</p>
<h1>Games</h1>
<h2>⭐ Undertale and Deltarune</h2>
<h2>⭐ Disco Elysium</h2>
<h2>⭐ In Stars and Time</h2>
<h2>Portal 2: 8/10</h2>
<p>Possibly a perfect game. It's not the best game, or a game that Literally Changed My Life. It's just one of the few perfect games; they had a concept, and executed it flawlessly and perfectly. Not every idea or concept has the capacity to change my life or appeal to my niches. 8/10</p>
<h2>Omori</h2>
<h1>Books, blogs, webstories</h1>
<h2>HPMOR (webstory)</h2>
<p>Extremely controversial, I know. But I liked it. Come at me.</p>
<p>It's just nice to have a protagonist who's more fully aware of the absurdity of the situation they're in. But I do agree that the writing style is terrible and all the characters are terrible. Some of my favourite moments from the book were when</p>
<h2>The Martian (book)</h2>
<p>better than the movie, but the movie did it's best and it's not bad either.</p>
<h1>Movies, shows, youtube videos</h1>
<h2>House MD</h2>
<p>Honestly probably the best comedy show I have seen. I mean it's more like a drama show, because there is lots of seriousness as well, but it is more like a sitcom, where each episode can be watched without having watched every previous episode.</p>
<p>Unlike shows like Brooklyn 99 or The Office which derive their comedy from autism or stupidity, House MD derives its comedy from pure <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetencePorn">competence porn</a>; everyone is smarter than average, everyone has an opinion, and everyone wants to psycho-analyse every single other person (so much that it just <em>drives me mad</em> sometimes lmao). Even the <em>patients</em> are smart; the most eccentric patients have the most well-written, eloquent and convincing arguments or justifications for why they are who they are.</p>
<h1>Contact Me</h1>
<p>If you'd like to go fanboy/fangirl/fan-they nuts in my DMs; I promise I will reciprocate. Or if you'd like to give me any suggestions;, including suggestions I have already received. Or if you hate me now and would like to kill me. In any case, ways I can be contacted can be found on my frontpage, just feeling a little lazy to get them here. I would just love to read your rants and/or messy thoughts in any form or another. Maybe just go to my Github, copy my entire repo for my website, and reconfigure for yourself?</p>
